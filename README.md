Food Delivery Time Prediction 🛵

A machine learning project to predict food delivery times based on order data, improving customer experience and logistics.

🔍 Overview

This project uses historical delivery data (distance, vehicle type, prep time, etc.) to train regression models and estimate delivery time accurately.

🛠 Tech Stack

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Model: Random Forest Regressor (best performer)  
- Optional: XGBoost, Flask/Streamlit for deployment

📈 Results

- **MAE:** ~10.5 minutes  
- **RMSE:** ~13.4 minutes  
- Shows strong alignment between actual and predicted delivery times.
